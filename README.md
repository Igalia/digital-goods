Welcome to the [WICG](https://www.w3.org/community/wicg/) repository for the
Digital Goods API. This is a Web API proposal for querying and managing digital
products to facilitate in-app purchases from web applications, in conjunction
with the [Payment Request API](https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/) (which is
used to make the actual purchases).
